      "explanation": "The typical test objectives are: \n• Evaluating work products such as requirements, user stories, designs, and code \n• Causing failures and finding defects \n• Ensuring required coverage of a test object \n• Reducing the risk level of inadequate software quality \n• Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled \n• Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements \n• Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions \n• Building confidence in the quality of the test object \n• Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders.\n Test objectives can vary, depending upon the context, which includes the work product being tested, the test level, risks, the software development lifecycle (SDLC) being followed, and factors related to the business context, e.g., corporate structure, competitive considerations, or time to market.

          { "text": "a) Having testers involved during various software development lifecycle (SDLC) activities will help to detect defects in work products", "correct": true },

        "explanation": "1.2.1. Testing’s Contributions to Success \nTesting provides a cost-effective means of detecting defects. These defects can then be removed (by debugging – a non-testing activity), so testing indirectly contributes to higher quality test objects. \nTesting provides a means of directly evaluating the quality of a test object at various phases in the SDLC. These measures are used as part of a larger project management activity, contributing to decisions to move to the next phase of the SDLC, such as the release decision. \nTesting provides users with indirect representation on the development project. Testers ensure that their understanding of users’ needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle. The alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of the development project, which is not usually possible due to the high costs and lack of availability of suitable users. \nTesting may also be required to meet contractual or legal requirements, or to comply with regulatory standards.
